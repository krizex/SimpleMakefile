# SimpleMakefile
a simple makefile

----
Usage:
copy Makefile to your code dir, and create dir `include`,`source` and `libs`.
After you have done the steps, your directory should look like this:
```
include
libs
Makefile
source
```

Now, put your source code `.c/.cpp` to folder `source`, and put header file `.h` to `include`.
If you have some extend librarys, please put it to folder `libs`, and modify Makefile to ensure your program will link with it when compiling.
